                                <p class="lead">We're looking for a Social Media Analyst with 3-4 years of experience analyzing paid and organic social media campaigns and delivering thoughtful, strategic analytics insights to Fortune 100 clients. You'll be a key player on Praytell's strategy team by providing robust reporting, developing detailed analytics and insights, curating social strategy recommendations and sharing best practices on industry trends and tools. After settling in as our analyst, a key component of this role will involve being trained to set up, execute and manage paid social media campaigns. Yes, that’s right - we’re hoping to train our analyst in all the tricks and tools of the trade. If you’re a self-professed data and analytics junkie with an ability to translate your passion into rich insights for our social strategy and account teams and key clients– let’s talk.
