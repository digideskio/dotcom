                                <p class="super-lead">Praytell is looking for a skilled designer to support our leading creative team. Ideally you’re a passionate designer with all things creative on your mind - you’re curious about new design modalities, discovering smart, creative ways to create beautiful productions and you’ve got a colorful portfolio of your own. Praytell’s new design star will assist the team in developing fresh visual identities, killer pitch presentations, layouts for web editorial and social media content across our diverse array of clientele - and much, much more.</p>

								<p class="lead">A little about us. We're the fastest growing agency in Brooklyn with outposts in San Francisco, Austin, Chicago and LA. In addition to the stellar creative team, you’ll be working with seasoned agency professionals who’ve led some of the largest social brand campaigns out there and colleagues committed to mentorship and career development. In addition to being PR Week’s Best Place to Work two years running, we offer a flexible work environment with amazing people and a kitchen filled with all the best snacks (plus we have a sweet beer/food hall right below us). We also offer unlimited vacation (and mean it), an employee wellness program, and regularly donate our time supporting <a href="http://praytellagency.com/culture" target="_blank">greater good projects</a>.</p>
                                
                                <p class="lead">If you’re ready to design at a start­up with incredible clients, infectious energy and eyes on global domination (while still being decent and interesting people) then shoot us an email. Or a <a href="https://twitter.com/praytellagency" target="_blank">Tweet</a> with a customized GIF (we love GIFs). Up to you, just make it interesting.
