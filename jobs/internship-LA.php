                                <p class="super-lead">Praytell is an agency that does things a little differently. One of our biggest differentiators is that while we do traditional PR really well, we place equal emphasis on new school PR</p>

								<p class="lead">So while we still pitch so-called traditional media and do the foundational comms work (op-eds, speaker bureaus, proactive media, etc.), we also create social media content, develop apps, websites, and in general, big ideas for today’s media landscape that are right for the times, the client and consumer. We opened our doors in April 2013 and have grown into a team of 50 people across offices in NY, San Fran, Chicago, Austin and LA, with a killer company culture and eyes on global domination. If you're looking for a stuffy, rigid, do-your-work-don't-ask-questions type of an experience, this ain't it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Oh, and we have a dog that works at the LA office too. *P.S. PRWeek named us one of the Best Places to Work and Boutique Agency of the Year, and recently, we joined a global agency network named Project which gives us a plenty of opportunities to collaborate with thirteen creative agencies around the world. </p>
                                
                                <p>Praytell is looking for smart, savvy public relations interns to come into the office and help the team out 2-3 days/week for at least a 3-month period. The internship is paid ($13/hr), office snacks are plentiful, and we work in fun and vibrant WeWork private office space and will be moving to Hollywood come November 1st. We know school schedules come first, and we are open to working with you on time/days/etc. Check out the fine print below, and hit us up if we’re speaking your language!</p>

                        <p><em>"The fact that I had real responsibility surprised me. I was granted tasks that had a very real impact on client relationships. I was over-the-moon that my co-workers trusted me enough to not destroy anything!"</em></p>
                        
						<p><em>"I really loved that I was included in the brainstorming process. It was cool to see ideas from a board turn into something active. I never felt like 'just an intern' here.  I also love the company culture.  I’ve never been in a workplace that was filled with so much laughter and support."</em></p>
                        
						<p><em>"This internship was so unlike 99.99% of internships. Every day that I came in, I left feeling happy that someone trusted me to work on something that really mattered or spent the time teaching me about something new."</em></p>
